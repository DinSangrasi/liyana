# Age - Sex - Ethnicity Detector

I use [UTKFace dataset](https://susanqq.github.io/UTKFace/) in this folder.



Download CNN and LightGBM models from [this google drive page](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1d_mlZ2PphVS-A8pcex0bFo-WxfznqSZu) and extract. These models trained with regular classification methods but i will update them later. For now, this folder is not a priority.



| Results                                  | Age   | Sex   | Ethnicity |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----- | ----- | --------- |
| Current Model Validation Accuracy Scores | %46.4 | %93.2 | %88.5     |



## TO DO

- [ ] Train Age Model with ArcFace
- [ ] Train at least %95 validation accuracy models

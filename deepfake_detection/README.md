# DeepFake Detection Scripts

I use [Dataset V4](http://kaggle.com/c/deepfake-detection-challenge/) in this folder. For more information about this dataset please go check *dataset* folder.



DeepFake detection from one single image is hard so until i add advanced video analysis feature this folder won't be updated.



Current model achieves %81 validation accuracy on Dataset V4. You can download from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1aCLebpZiC5T7EpImgCEQrspbsN-9dPB6)
